## Need Help?

To report an incident, please review the reporting guide and email conduct@lamingtonjs.com.

## Purpose

Lamington JS aims to be a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment. As such, we are committed to providing a harassment-free experience for all, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, socioeconomic status, or religion (or lack thereof).

## Scope

We expect all attendees, speakers, sponsors, and staff to abide by this Code of Conduct in Lamington JS community venues–online and in-person–as well as in one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.

## Expectations

At Lamington JS, we ask that everyone:
- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.
- Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:
- Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
- Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
- Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”).
- Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
- Inappropriate photography or recording.
- Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before touching them.
- Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
- Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.
If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, Lamington JS organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behaviour, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organiser as soon as possible.

[Reporting Guidelines](/conduct-reporting)

Additionally, community organisers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behaviour feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organisers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

## Addressing grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the Lamington JS Code of Conduct response team at with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our reporting guidelines.
